The project, titled "SNIFF-N-PAWS (Foster Home for Pets)," aims to develop an online management system for an organization providing a nurturing environment for pets in need of special attention and shelter. The system integrates a Database Management System (DBMS) to efficiently catalog and manage animals based on their traits and types. The project also focuses on digitalizing the adoption system to simplify and enhance customer access. With the goal of providing crisis care for animals during disasters, the project outlines the potential real-life benefits of its implementation.

The literature review examines two relevant papers, namely "Case Study: DBMS Pet Shop" and "Pet Care Management System Capstone Project Document." The first paper discusses the creation of a user-friendly interface utilizing a DBMS for efficient operations in a pet shop, emphasizing automation for seamless business processes. The second paper focuses on enhancing the management system in a pet hospital, featuring organized record handling, pet health monitoring, medical history management, and consultation services. Both papers highlight the advantages of integrating a DBMS in pet care scenarios.

The design and implementation of the project include an Entity-Relationship (ER) diagram, schema diagram, and detailed features and functionalities for different user roles such as Admin, Veterinarian, and Customer. The project uses tools like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP, Oracle, and Node.js for the front end, back end, and database components. The limitations include aspects like donation system implementation and security vulnerabilities, with future scopes suggesting improvements such as online banking integration, user verification, data abstraction, and enhanced user experience.
